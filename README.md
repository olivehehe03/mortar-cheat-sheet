# Mortar elevation cheat sheet

This is web based version of the ZSU Mortar Cheat Sheet PDF for recording data and assisting with the calculations required to perform the Rhino Indirect Fire Support role in Arma 3 Missions

This app was created in a couple of hours because I can, so styling is bare minimum to match the original PDF with just enough to be usable on a tablet or phone

WhY dId YoU uSe `x` InStEaD of `y`?  Because these are the tools I use on a daily basis so they are familiar and much easier to work with than learning something new for a 1 day project
